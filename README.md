>Decimal places patterns

---------------------------------------------

### Description:
Recursive function to compute patterns of decimal places when denominator is a repetition of 1 or more '3' and that the numerator is not divisible by the denominator. The decimal places "pattern" has as much digits than the denominator and repeats itself many times. I can't prove it yet but hopefully someone has already found this fun math puzzle
